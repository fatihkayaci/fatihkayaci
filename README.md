# Hi there, I'm Fatih KAYACI! 👋

## 💻 About Me
I'm a **Computer Engineer** passionate about software development and continuously expanding my expertise. During my academic journey, I built a solid foundation in **algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP)**. Over time, I worked with multiple programming languages, including **C#, Python, Java, PHP, and C**, which allowed me to develop a diverse perspective on software development.

Currently, I am specializing in **C# and ASP.NET Core**, focusing on developing scalable, high-performance applications. My experience includes building **web APIs, managing databases with Entity Framework Core, implementing dependency injection, and designing middleware**. Additionally, I continuously refine my understanding of **SOLID principles** to enhance my software architecture skills.

I strongly believe in continuous learning and improvement. I'm actively working on projects, sharing my progress on GitHub, and striving to contribute to the software development community. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient software engineer, delivering innovative and impactful solutions to real-world challenges.

🚀 Let's build something great together!
